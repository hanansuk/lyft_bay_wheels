## Lyft Bay Wheels
### Hanan Sukenik
------------------------------


- In this project, I will be using BiqQuery, command-line tools and a Jupyter Notebook to explore the Lyft Bay Wheels (https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels) datasets and provide the company with offers to increase ridership.

- Through this project, I will be focusing on the following two questions:

    * What are the 5 most popular "commuter trips"
    
    * Recommendations for offers to increase rideship
    
  
- The project is split into two files:

    * hanan_sukenik_project_1.md - In this notebook, I will be exploring the datasets using the Google BigQuery GUI interface in the cloud as well as Linux command line
    
    * Project_1.ipynb - In this Jupyter Notebook, I will query from a Jupyter Notebook and use Pandas and Seaborn to present a report answering the above two questions
    
    
 - General Notes:
 
     * As you will see in the Jupyter Notebook, the main challenge for this project was isolating commuter trips from the general trips population. This was done using some basic assumptions, based on previous knowledge and common sense.
     
     * Additional data will be required to come up with definitive conclusions regarding potential offers, but considering the data we have on hand, I do believe the offers are relevant and legitimate.
     
     
Enjoy!
